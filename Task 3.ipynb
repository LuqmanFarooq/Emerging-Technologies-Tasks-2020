    "The standard deviation of an array of numbers x is calculated using numpy as np.sqrt(np.sum((x - np.mean(x))* *2)/len(x)) . However, Microsoft Excel has two different versions of the standard deviation calculation, STDEV.P and STDEV.S . The STDEV.P function performs the above calculation but in the STDEV.S calculation the division is by len(x)-1 rather than len(x) . Research these Excel functions, writing a note in a Markdown cell about the difference between them. Then use numpy to perform a simulation demonstrating that the STDEV.S calculation is a better estimate for the standard deviation of a population when performed on a sample. Note that part of this task is to figure out the terminology in the previous sentence."
